# Motorola MX240a Driver

An attempt at writing a driver to use [this thing](https://twitter.com/y2k_aesthetic/status/1101736668975910912).

Now that AIM is long dead the IMFree is basically useless, so I wanted to try hooking it into Discord

You could also use it for whatever else because this is pretty much just a Python API to talk to the handset

Documentation on the protocol mainly from https://github.com/sanko/device-mx240a 

### Requirements
Python 3.8, hidapi, loguru
